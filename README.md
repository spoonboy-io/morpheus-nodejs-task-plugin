# Node.js Morpheus Task Plugin

Write Morpheus automation tasks in Node.js

- Results of previous tasks are in an array (results) of key value objects
- Node.js must be installed on the appliance
- Modules must be installed on the appliance with the global flag `npm install -g modulename`
- The Plugin needs to be configured with the absolute path to the Node installation

## TODO
- Make the Morpheus vars available to the task
